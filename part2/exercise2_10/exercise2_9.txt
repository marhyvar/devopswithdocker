I changed backend's environment variable REQUEST_ORIGIN from
http://localhost:5000 to http://localhost
Otherwise, there would have been a Cross-Origin Request error:
CORS header ‘Access-Control-Allow-Origin’ missing
(different port, thus different origin).
So, when using nginx http://localhost needs to pass through the cors check. 
I changed frontend's REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL from
http://localhost:8080 to http://localhost/api
Also, I named backend and frontend containers for convenience.
